This repository contains three C-codes to create histograms.

dist_bin.c creates a histogram of the distance between two groups of atoms.
water_bin.c creates a histogram of the number of waters in the groove of nhTMEM16
lipid_tail_bin.c creats a histogram of the lipid tail atom count in the groove of nhTMEM16

dist_bin.c and water_bin.c are identical except of the bin size used. Currently, for dist_bin.c, the bin size is set to 0.2A; for water_bin.c the bin size is 2.
